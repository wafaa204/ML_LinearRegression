This project explain who to find the linear regression using this equation y=ax+b .
The library that used in the code numpy lib.
So First we store the x and y values in 2 arrays ,
Second we will find the number of tuple (n) to use it in the law ,
Third we will find the summation of both column x and y , multiply the 2 array to find the summation of x*y ..so you will have summation of x*y 
 --now we will write the law of a and b to find it then we compensate for it in the linear equation to find y --
 Fourth we divide the b_law for 2 parts numerator and denominator to make it easy to understand , now we write the law of b and collect the parts that have been divided .
 Fifth now we write the a_law ,then the value of a and b we will compensate it in equation 

 Finally if you want to round the value of y you can round it for 3 floating point or more you can use the formula in the end of the code that have beeen written ..

 we using Jupyter Notebook for testing and training the model .
